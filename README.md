# Databricks Optimization Strategies

This document outlines the best practices and strategies we've implemented to optimize Databricks usage for both **cost efficiency** and **performance**.

## ✅ What Worked Well

### 1. Prefer Job Clusters Over Interactive Clusters
Job clusters terminate automatically after execution, reducing cost compared to persistent interactive clusters.

### 2. Optimize Node Configuration
Configure driver and worker nodes independently. Avoid using the same SKU unless necessary.

### 3. Set Aggressive Auto-Termination Policies
Reduce idle costs by setting short auto-termination times for clusters.

### 4. Use Serverless SQL Warehouses for Short-Lived Queries
Ideal for fast, frequent queries (e.g., dashboards) with minimal overhead.

### 5. Use Spot Instances in Development Environments
Reduce cost in non-critical environments like dev/test by utilizing spot instances.

### 6. Leverage Serverless Jobs
Adopt serverless for workloads that benefit from autoscaling and minimal infrastructure management.

### 7. Implement an Effective Pooling Strategy
- **What didn’t work:** One pool per application.
- **What worked:** One pool per runtime version shared across applications.

### 8. Prioritize Cluster Types for Interactive Use Cases
Interactive workloads such as APIs, Power BI dashboards, and ad hoc queries benefit from fast, scalable access:
- **Use Serverless SQL Warehouse** for short-lived queries with infrequent load. It offers instant startup and cost efficiency for low-traffic scenarios.
- **Use Managed SQL Warehouse** for applications with continuous or high-frequency access, ensuring stable performance under sustained load.
- 
### 9. Prioritize Cluster Types for Batch Jobs
Use the following order of preference:
1. Serverless Job Clusters
2. Job Clusters
3. Interactive Clusters (last resort)

### 10. Stay Current with Runtime Versions
Upgrade Databricks runtime versions regularly to benefit from performance improvements and new features.

### 11. Optimize Code and Execution
Deep dive into machine-level performance and profile job runs. Apply code optimization practices to improve efficiency.

### 12. Use Databricks Workflows for Parallel Execution
For parallel jobs, orchestrate using Databricks Workflows to manage dependencies and improve throughput.

### 13. Apply Traditional Database Optimization Techniques
If a query is slow in a traditional RDBMS, it will be slower in Databricks. Use filtering, indexing, and query tuning.

### 14. Consolidate Smaller Jobs Thoughtfully
Group small jobs where possible, but preserve the ability to resume or retry specific steps independently.

### 15. Use Advanced Features Like Z-Ordering and Liquid Clustering
Enable features like **Z-Ordering** and **Liquid Clustering** (in newer runtimes) to improve data layout and query performance.
